This repository contains example data science projects that I have recently completed that do not relate to my current employer.

Below is a description of each project.

Project 1- Investigate a Dataset.

Summary: This is a project that I did for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. Overall, we were provided a few datasets and we had to choose one, pose a few questions that we wanted to answer about the dataset and then proceed to answer the questions and visualize our results.
