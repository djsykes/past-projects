This repository contains example data science projects that I have recently completed that do not relate to my work for my current employer.

Below is a description of each project.

Project 1- Investigate a Dataset.

Summary: This is a project that I did for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. Overall, we were provided a few datasets and we had to choose one, pose a few questions that we wanted to answer about the dataset and then proceed to answer the questions and visualize our results. The primary tool used for this analysis was Python. The related files are "Project 1- Investigate a Dataset Project.pdf.", this contains the results of the analysis and the code is in "Project 1- Titantic June 24 2017.py."

Project 2- Program Your Own Quiz.

Summary: This is a project that I did for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. We had to program a fill in the blank quiz about python terms. It had to have three levels of difficulty and the player had to the number of incorrect responses that they were allowed to have. The primary tool used for this project was Python. The file that relates to this is "Project 2- Quiz Project 2017"
