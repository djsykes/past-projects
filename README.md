This repository contains example data science projects that I have recently completed that do not relate to my work for my current employer.

Below is a description of each project.

Project 1- Investigate a Dataset

Summary: This is a project that I did for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. Overall, we were provided a few datasets and we had to choose one, pose a few questions that we wanted to answer about the dataset and then proceed to answer the questions and visualize our results. The primary tool used for this analysis was Python. The related files are "Project 1- Investigate a Dataset Project.pdf.", this contains the results of the analysis and the code is in "Project 1- Titantic June 24 2017.py."

Project 2- Program Your Own Quiz

Summary: This is a project that I did for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. We had to program a fill in the blank quiz about python terms. It had to have three levels of difficulty and the player had to the number of incorrect responses that they were allowed to have. The primary tool used for this project was Python. The file that relates to this is "Project 2- Quiz Project 2017"

Project 3- Clustering, Classifying and Forecasting

Summary: This project was the capstone project for the Udacity Predictive Analytics Nanodegree. In general, we had to analyze sales data in order to identify the various store formats that the client should move to and then for the new locations that they were planning on opening, predict the store type that should be built there and then forcast sales for all stores. The primary tools used in this analysis were Alteryx and Tableau. The file that relates to this is "Project 3- Clustering, Classifying and Forecasting.pdf"

Project 4- Tableau

Summary: This project relates to the Udacity Predictive Analytics Nanodegree. The premise of the project was that my client is a new movie production company looking to make a new movie. The client wants to make sure it’s successful to help make a name for the new company and they want me to analyze some provided movie data. They’ have provided me with guidance to look into three specific areas:

1- How have movie genres changed over time?
2- How do Universal and Paramount differ?
3. How do movies based on novels performed compare relatively to movies not based on novels?

I was asked to develop a fourth question and the fourth question that I developed is whether or not that they should hire Nicolas Cage to be in their film. The file that relates to this is "Project 4- Tableau.pdf" This project was performed in Tableau.

Project 5- AB Testing

Sumamry: For this project, a client wants to adopt a new menu for its stores. Before rolling it out to all of the stores, they want to test the market. I performed an AB test along with identifying control units. From there, I then forecasted potential sales. This project was primarily performed in Alteryx. The file that relates to this is "Project 5-AB Testing.pdf"
